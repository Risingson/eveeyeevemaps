Universe map for Eve Online and Eve Echoes
The maps are not the exact eve online map but are modified by myself just a bit to overlap less.

You can use the files for your projects but need to link to eveeye.com or echoes.eveeye.com for your web/app (in a visible way, not from the last corner of your web/app ;)

I would say you should have a license from CCP to use the Eve Online IP in your web/app.
For Eve Online there is developers.eveonline.com 
I do not know if this is valid for Eve Echoes aswell. You should contact CCP or Netease about it.
